  "description": "JSGame is a fun and colorful game comprised of four parts: + Disc   + A user controlled disc in the middle of the canvas.   + Only one instance of this disc.   + The user controls the rotation of the disc with their mouse.   + The disc is split by color. + Projectiles   + A projectile comes from off the screen from random positions towards the user's disc.   + The projectile is colored based on any of the colors of the user's disc.   + The projectile will collide with the user's disc, and will reflect in a direction based on the incoming angle and velocity of the rotation of the disc.   + If the color of the ball is the same as the side of the disc that it collides with, it will bounce off.   + If not, the ball will stick to the outside of the disc.   + Projectiles cannot bounce off parts of the disc that are covered in projectiles. + Goals   + Goals will be placed around the canvas and the objective is to get the projectiles to go towards and pass the goals. + Power-ups   + Such power-ups will be implemented:     + The user can release all the stuck projectiles on the disc in directions normal to the the face of the disc.     + The user gains the ability to shoot incoming projectiles.",
